## EECS-3421-Database-Application

York River Bookseller's Database Search and Purchase Application Program

This is just a repository of a search and purchase *Java* application that operates on the *York River Bookseller's Database* (YRB for short).

The application can be executed on York University's computers or any computer that has a DB2 license.

The provided script (i.e., *run.sh*) can be used to create and drop the database, compile the application and install the DB2 license. Note that the license installation only works on York University's computers.
For details on how to use the script, allow it to be run as a program (i.e., *chmod +x run.sh* on Linux) and then run it without any arguments (i.e., *./run.sh* on Linux) and then you can read the displayed messages for more details.
